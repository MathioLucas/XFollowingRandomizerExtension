# XFollowingRandomizerExtension
Randomizes tweets in the following section of X. This aims to mimic the For You page but with your followers tweets instead.

Running the extension:

1. Download all the files and save them in a folder on your computer.
2. Go to settings on Chrome and go click the extensions tab.
3.  Enable devloper mode, click load package and click the folder with all the files.
4.  Go to x and click the extension adn the checkbox if you want to randomize posts.

   ** Going over the code and the errors I get on console, I think the issue is I need permmision from X in order for the extension to work.
   I'll try contacting X but I think all I can do is leave it up to them to decide if they will let me use the extension or not.
   If anyone has contact with them and could guide/help me, I would appreciate it!
